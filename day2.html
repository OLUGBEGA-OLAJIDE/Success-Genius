	<h3 style=": yellow">POLYGON</h5>
	
		<p>The word 'poly' means many and the word 'gon' means angled. Therefore, a polygon means a many angled. In mathematics,we have the word polygon to be a many angled shape.<p>Therefore the general name for a 2-dimensional shape is polygon. The simplest form of a polygon is a triangle. All quadrilaterals are also examples of polygon. However because triangles and quadrilaterals have their own special properties they are usually called specially.  and Generally, polygon derive their names from the number of sides and the types of angles included. The table below shows some special polygons and their sides.<p>

		<P>A Triangle is a three sided polygon(plane figure) with three angles.</P><p style="color: red">Types of Triangles</p><p>
			(a) A scalene triangle has no side and no angle equal.</p><p>(b) An equilateral triangle has all sides and angles equal.</p><p>(c) An isosceles triangle has just two sides and angles equal.</p><p style="color: green">QUADRILATERAL</p>
			<h4 style="color:purple">SQUARES</h4>

	<p>Squares are quadrilaterals which has all sides equal. Squares are special quadrilaterals and even special shape because there is no other quadrilateral which has all sides equal.</p><p>
		The formula for finding the area of a square is;l*l and the formula  for the perimeter is 4l which shows the 4 equal length of each side of the square.
